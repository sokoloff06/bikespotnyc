# Project Blueprint: NYC Bicycle Parking Finder

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a Flutter application that displays bicycle parking locations in New York City on an interactive map. The application will fetch data from the NYC OpenData portal, implement caching to reduce network requests, and display the parking spots as markers on a Google Map.

## Features

*   **Interactive Map:** Users will see a map of NYC with markers indicating bicycle parking locations.
*   **Marker Clustering:** To improve performance and readability, markers will be clustered together at higher zoom levels.
*   **Data Caching:** The application will cache the parking data to provide a faster experience and reduce API usage. Data will be refreshed periodically.
*   **Detailed Information:** Tapping on a parking marker will display more information about that location.

## Architecture

*   **State Management:** Provider for managing the state of the parking data.
*   **Data Fetching:** The `http` package will be used to make requests to the NYC OpenData API.
*   **Mapping:** The `google_maps_flutter` package will be used to display the interactive map and handle marker clustering.
*   **Caching:** The `shared_preferences` package will be used to store the data locally.

## Plan

1.  **Set up the project:** Add the necessary dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`: `google_maps_flutter`, `http`, and `provider`, `shared_preferences`.
2.  **Create the data model:** Define a Dart class to represent the bicycle parking data.
3.  **Implement the API service:** Create a service to fetch the data from the NYC OpenData API and handle caching.
4.  **Create the map screen:**
    *   Set up the Google Map widget.
    *   Fetch the parking data using the API service.
    *   Implement marker clustering using the official Google Maps Flutter package.
    *   Display the parking locations as markers on the map.
5.  **Develop the main application:**
    *   Set up the main application widget.
    *   Use a `ChangeNotifierProvider` to provide the parking data to the map screen.
